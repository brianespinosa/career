See `docs/adr/008-playwright-e2e.md` for framework selection rationale.

## Running Tests

Tests require a deployed Vercel URL — they do not run against `next dev`.
Set environment variables before running:

- `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` — the target URL (e.g., a Vercel preview deployment URL)
- `VERCEL_BYPASS_SECRET` — Vercel protection bypass token

These variables are required for tests to pass, not for the config to load. When
`PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` is unset, `playwright.config.ts` falls back to
`http://localhost:3000` so config-loading tools (e.g. knip) work without it;
running the tests without a deployed URL fails at test time with connection
errors. Never set a fabricated `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` to satisfy tooling.

## Selector Strategy

**Prefer `getByRole` and other accessible locators. Never use `data-testid` or other test-only attributes.**

Playwright's accessible locator API — `getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText` — queries the accessibility tree rather than the DOM. This means tests interact with the app the same way a screenreader or assistive technology would.

Reasons to avoid `data-testid`:

- **It tests nothing meaningful.** A `data-testid` can exist on a completely inaccessible element — broken ARIA role, missing accessible name, wrong semantics — and the test would still pass. You get coverage of behavior but not of accessibility.
- **It couples tests to implementation.** Test IDs are noise in the production markup. They require discipline to maintain and are easily orphaned when components are refactored.
- **`getByRole` gives you both for free.** If `page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Reset' })` passes, you know the element exists, has the correct ARIA role, and has a meaningful accessible name. A regression in any of those properties fails the test — which is the right outcome.

Locator priority (highest to lowest):

1. `page.getByRole(role, { name })` — role + accessible name from the accessibility tree
2. `page.getByLabel(text)` — form elements associated with a `<label>` or `aria-label`
3. `page.getByText(text)` — visible text content, for non-interactive elements
4. CSS/attribute selectors — only as a last resort when no semantic locator applies

When a test cannot be written without a `data-testid`, treat it as a signal that the component is missing accessible semantics — fix the component, not the test.

## Scoping Locators

Use chained locators to scope queries to a subtree when multiple elements share the same accessible name:

```ts
// Two "Reset" buttons exist: the IconButton and the AlertDialog confirm.
// Scope to the dialog to disambiguate — equivalent to Testing Library's within().
await page.getByRole('alertdialog').getByRole('button', { name: 'Reset' }).click();
```

## Dynamic Import Timing

`RatingsChart` and `OpportunitiesCard` are loaded via `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` — they are absent from the initial server-rendered HTML. Do not assert on them immediately after navigation.

Playwright's `expect` assertions auto-wait up to the configured timeout, so this is sufficient:

```ts
await expect(page.getByRole('tab', { name: 'Opportunities' })).toBeVisible();
```

No explicit `waitForSelector` or `waitFor` wrapper is needed.

Note: `OpportunitiesCard` renders a `Tabs.Root` (Radix UI) — "Opportunities" is a `role="tab"` element, not a heading.

## Known Stable URLs

- `/P1/3ckmgrhn` — P1 level with a known encoded ratings set (also used in Lighthouse CI)

## Test Files

- `home.spec.ts` — home page headings render; axe accessibility scan passes
- `level-navigation.spec.ts` — CareerSelect navigates to the correct level URL and renders the level heading
- `url-rating-encoding.spec.ts` — pre-encoded URLs restore correct rating state in RatingSelect dropdowns
- `reset.spec.ts` — ResetButton clears ratings and updates URL; AlertDialog cancel leaves state unchanged
- `opportunities-card.spec.ts` — OpportunitiesCard is absent with no ratings, visible with ratings; sort order and animated opacity; axe scan on rated page
- `smart-goals.spec.ts` — Goal Prompt tab renders textarea with level name; copy button writes to clipboard
- `og-image.spec.ts` — OG image routes return status 200 with image content-type
- `ratings-chart.spec.ts` — arc click scrolls attribute heading into viewport; EM level page renders heading and comboboxes
